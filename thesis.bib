  abstract = 	 {We build new test sets for the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Both benchmarks have been the focus of intense research for almost a decade, raising the danger of overfitting to excessively re-used test sets. By closely following the original dataset creation processes, we test to what extent current classification models generalize to new data. We evaluate a broad range of models and find accuracy drops of 3% - 15% on CIFAR-10 and 11% - 14% on ImageNet. However, accuracy gains on the original test sets translate to larger gains on the new test sets. Our results suggest that the accuracy drops are not caused by adaptivity, but by the models’ inability to generalize to slightly "harder" images than those found in the original test sets.}

abstract = {In the framework of an intelligent assembly information system, the three-dimensional model of a product serves as a critical information source for the system, which also provides initial product feature information for assembly sequence planning. At present, in the process of extracting information from the STEP neutral file, the products are rarely performed at the assembly level. In addition, the characteristic of semantic expression of the same parts included in a product is always ignored. In this paper, based on the theory of ontology, the OntoSTEP model is constructed to extract information from STEP neutral files at the assembly level. A set of extraction rules for the basic corresponding information of the same parts in the assembly are developed. Further, a SWRL rule library is established in Protégé to realize the comprehensive information extraction of the assembly hierarchy for a product from its 3D model, which lays the foundation for the assembly sequence planning.}

displays (HMDs) and handheld devices, promise support for everyday remote collaboration.
Despite their potential for widespread use, their effectiveness as collaborative tools
is unknown, particularly in physical tasks involving mobility. To better understand
their impact on collaborative behaviors, perceptions, and performance, we conducted
a two-by-two (technology type: HMD vs. tablet computer; task setting: static vs. dynamic)
between-subjects study where participants (n=66) remotely collaborated as ``helper'
and ``worker' pairs in the construction of a physical object. Our results showed that,
in the dynamic task, HMD use enabled helpers to offer more frequent directing commands
and more proactive assistance, resulting in marginally faster task completion. In
the static task, while tablet use helped convey subtle visual information, helpers
and workers had conflicting perceptions of how the two technologies contributed to
their success. Our findings offer strong design and research implications, underlining
the importance of a consistent view of the shared workspace and the differential support
collaborators with different roles receive from technologies.},

techniques for digital fabrication. However, little attention in this body of work
has examined how to involve and guide human workers in fabricating larger-scale structures.
We propose a novel model of crowdsourced fabrication, in which a large number of workers
and volunteers are guided through the process of building a pre-designed structure.
The process is facilitated by an intelligent construction space capable of guiding
individual workers and coordinating the overall build process. More specifically,
we explore the use of smartwatches, indoor location sensing, and instrumented construction
materials to provide real-time guidance to workers, coordinated by a foreman engine
that manages the overall build process. We report on a three day deployment of our
system to construct a 12-tall bamboo pavilion with assistance from more than one hundred
volunteer workers, and reflect on observations and feedback collected during the exhibit.},

with the physical model. The system allows users to author a new model and uses the
inferred assembly process to guide its recreation by others. We propose a novel way
of assembly guidance where the next block to be added is rendered in blinking mode
with the tracked virtual model on screen. The system is also able to detect any mistakes
made and helps correct them by providing appropriate feedback. We focus on assemblies
of Duplo® blocks.We discuss the shortcomings of existing methods of guidance - static
figures or recorded videos - and demonstrate how our method avoids those shortcomings.
We also report on a user study to compare our system with standard figure-based guidance
methods found in user manuals. The results of the user study suggest that our method
is able to aid users' structural perception of the model better, leads to fewer assembly
errors, and reduces model construction time.},

how to split up the task, how to assign subtasks to each other, and in what order
subtasks should be completed. Informed by an observational study examining group coordination
challenges, we built a task distribution system called WeBuild. Our custom algorithm
dynamically assigns subtasks to workers in a group, taking into account factors such
as the dependencies between subtasks and the skills of each group member. Each worker
views personalized step-by-step instructions on a mobile phone, while a dashboard
visualizes the entire process. An initial study found that WeBuild reduced the start-up
time needed to coordinate and begin a task, and provides direction for future research
to build on toward improving group efficiency and coordination for complex tasks.},

While prototypical studies of such applications exist today, the relationship between infrastructure service provisioning and its implication for WCA usability is largely unexplored despite the relevance that these applications have for future networks. This paper presents an experimental study assessing how WCA users react to varying end-to-end delays induced by the application pipeline or infrastructure. Participants interacted directly with an instrumented task-guidance WCA as delays were introduced into the system in a controllable fashion. System and task state were tracked in real time, and biometric data from wearable sensors on the participants were recorded. Our results show that periods of extended system delay cause users to correspondingly (and substantially) slow down in their guided task execution, an effect that persists for a time after the system returns to a more responsive state. Furthermore, the slow-down in task execution is correlated with a personality trait, neuroticism, associated with intolerance for time delays. We show that our results implicate impaired cognitive planning, as contrasted with resource depletion or emotional arousal, as the reason for slowed user task executions under system delay. The findings have several implications for the design and operation of WCA applications as well as computational and communication infrastructure, and additionally for the development of performance analysis tools for WCA.},

Automating disassembly of these electronic products is a vital part of improving end-of-life product treatment where hazardous chemicals and materials are present.

This requires the removal, and hence detection, of fasteners like screws in a disassembly environment. Crosshead screws are a common fastener type used in LCD monitors. This paper proposes a method of screw detection for disassembly and presents results of detection of crosshead screws on components of various models of LCD monitors in a disassembly cell. The system first applies gamma correction to standardize brightness––or luminance–– of images. Generic knowledge about screw features in the form of a deep learning model is then used to visually detects screws. The results are analyzed against common screw location combinations on product components in order to logically reason about possible undetected screws that are also likely to exist. Finally, true negative detections are collected as new training data and the deep learning model is re-trained on these missed detections to improve performance; tailoring and adapting to the environment of the specific disassembly cell.}

abstract="Deep Learning methods usually require huge amounts of training data to perform at their full potential, and often require expensive manual labeling. Using synthetic images is therefore very attractive to train object detectors, as the labeling comes for free, and several approaches have been proposed to combine synthetic and real images for training. In this paper, we evaluate if `freezing' the layers responsible for feature extraction to generic layers pre-trained on real images, and training only the remaining layers with plain OpenGL rendering may allow for training with synthetic images only. Our experiments with very recent deep architectures for object recognition (Faster-RCNN, R-FCN, Mask-RCNN) and image feature extractors (InceptionResnet and Resnet) show this simple approach performs surprisingly well.",

 abstract = {A call center is a service network in which agents provide telephone-based services. Customers who seek these services are delayed in tele-queues. This article summarizes an analysis of a unique record of call center operations. The data comprise a complete operational history of a small banking call center, call by call, over a full year. Taking the perspective of queueing theory, we decompose the service process into three fundamental components: arrivals, customer patience, and service durations. Each component involves different basic mathematical structures and requires a different style of statistical analysis. Some of the key empirical results are sketched, along with descriptions of the varied techniques required. Several statistical techniques are developed for analysis of the basic components. One of these techniques is a test that a point process is a Poisson process. Another involves estimation of the mean function in a nonparametric regression with lognormal errors. A new graphical technique is introduced for nonparametric hazard rate estimation with censored data. Models are developed and implemented for forecasting of Poisson arrival rates. Finally, the article surveys how the characteristics deduced from the statistical analyses form the building blocks for theoretically interesting and practically useful mathematical models for call center operations.},

 abstract = {The stochastic processes which occur in the theory of queues are in general not Markovian and special methods are required for their analysis. In many cases the problem can be greatly simplified by restricting attention to an imbedded Markov chain. In this paper some recent work on single-server queues is first reviewed from this standpoint, and the method is then applied to the analysis of the following many-server queuing-system: Input: the inter-arrival times are independently and identically distributed in an arbitrary manner. Queue-discipline: "first come, first served." Service-mechanism: a general number, s, of servers; negative-exponential service-times. If Q is the number of people waiting at an instant just preceding the arrival of a new customer, and if w is the waiting time of an arbitrary customer, then it will be shown that the equilibrium distribution of Q is a geometric series mixed with a concentration at Q = 0 and that the equilibrium distribution of w is a negative-exponential distribution mixed with a concentration at w = 0. (In the particular case of a single server this property of the waiting-time distribution was first discovered by W. L. Smith.) The paper concludes with detailed formulae and numerical results for the following particular cases: Numbers of servers: s = 1, 2 and 3. Types of input: (i) Poissonian and (ii) regular.},

While prototypical studies of such applications exist today, the relationship between infrastructure service provisioning and its implication for WCA usability is largely unexplored despite the relevance that these applications have for future networks. This paper presents an experimental study assessing how WCA users react to varying end-to-end delays induced by the application pipeline or infrastructure. Participants interacted directly with an instrumented task-guidance WCA as delays were introduced into the system in a controllable fashion. System and task state were tracked in real time, and biometric data from wearable sensors on the participants were recorded. Our results show that periods of extended system delay cause users to correspondingly (and substantially) slow down in their guided task execution, an effect that persists for a time after the system returns to a more responsive state. Furthermore, the slow-down in task execution is correlated with a personality trait, neuroticism, associated with intolerance for time delays. We show that our results implicate impaired cognitive planning, as contrasted with resource depletion or emotional arousal, as the reason for slowed user task executions under system delay. The findings have several implications for the design and operation of WCA applications as well as computational and communication infrastructure, and additionally for the development of performance analysis tools for WCA.},

In this paper, we propose an adaptation-based strategy to allow scaling up the number of concurrent edge-native applications on a resource-limited cloudlet and wireless network. We demonstrate up to 40% reduction in offered load with minimal impact on latency on a variety of cognitive assistance tasks over non-adaptive approaches. Our approach is able to gracefully degrade and maintain quality of service for a subset of applications in the face of severely loaded conditions.},

abstract="A number of proposals have been advanced in recent years for the development of ``general systems theory'' which, abstracting from properties peculiar to physical, biological, or social systems, would be applicable to all of them. We might well feel that, while the goal is laudable, systems of such diverse kinds could hardly be expected to have any nontrivial properties in common. Metaphor and analogy can be helpful, or they can be misleading. All depends on whether the similarities the metaphor captures are significant or superficial.",

abstract = {This position paper examines a spectrum of approaches to overcoming the limited computing power of mobile devices caused by their need to be small, lightweight and energy efficient. At one extreme is offloading of compute-intensive operations to a cloudlet nearby. At the other extreme is the use of fixed-function hardware accelerators on mobile devices. Between these endpoints lie various configurations of programmable hardware accelerators. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and conclude that they are, in fact, complementary. Based on this insight, we advocate a software-hardware co-evolution path that combines their strengths.},
