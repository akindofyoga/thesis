\begin{abstract}
  Wearable Cognitive Assistance (WCA) applications run on wearable mobile
  devices, to provide guidance for real world tasks.
  Physical assembly tasks have been a significant focus of research on WCA.
  We introduce new techniques to support the development of WCA applications for
  more complex assembly tasks than previous techniques supported.
  In addition, our work reduces the load on developers creating WCA applications
  by eliminating the need to collect and label real training images.
  We accomplish this by training computer vision models on synthetically
  generated images.
  This dissertation investigates escalation to human experts in cases when a
  user is not satisfied with the automated guidance from an application.
  Lastly, we develop a new version of a software framework for WCA
  applications, and evaluate ways in which WCA applications can benefit from
  running computations directly on mobile devices.

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages,
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
