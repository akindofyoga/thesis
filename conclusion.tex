\subsection{Detecting Environmental Issues}

Our computer vision models might output an incorrect label if the object being
assembled is positioned at an awkward angle, or if the lighting in a room is
too dim.
WCA applications have no way of detecting when one of these issues have
occurred.
However, if the applications could detect issues like this, it could alert the
user.
This would prompt the user to correct the issue, and avoid incorrect computer
vision results.

\subsection{Computer Vision Techniques}

Deep Neural Networks make the assumption that training and testing data are
drawn from the same distribution.
Unfortunately, this will rarely be the case in practice for WCA applications.
The lighting conditions that the application is used in and defects in how parts
are manufactured can introduce biases in the data that the application sees at
runtime.
Biases that did not exist in the training data can cause the DNNs used by the
application to perform poorly.
Each task that a developer creates a WCA application for requires its own
training set.
This limits the size of the training set that would be practical to collect in
order to develop one of these applications.
If computer vision models that are more robust to differences in training and
test datasets are developed, this will improve the reliability of WCA
applications.
